# Hash Table Implementation

This file contains a Python script with an implementation of a hash table for storing and retrieving key-value pairs. The hash function used in this implementation is an existing one called `djb2`, which is a widely-used hash function. Also the actual functionality was not created from scratch but found online created by an unknown source.

## Functionality

The hash table includes the following functionalities:

- Insertion of key-value pairs
- Lookup of values associated with keys
- Deletion of key-value pairs
- Resizing of the hash table when necessary
- Getting the size and length of the nash table

## Usage

The hash table implementation has been tested and is fully functional. It includes usage demonstrating how to count word frequencies in the book "The Alien Intelligence".
